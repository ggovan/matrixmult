# Parallel Spare Matrix Multiplication

Some old sparse matrix multiplication stuff in Java and Scala.
The Java performed well against the C (or was it C++) benchmark we were comparing against.
The Scala version needs work, I wrote it when I didn't have a firm grasp on the collections library; it could very much be improved.
